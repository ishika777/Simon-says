# Simon Says Game

A fun and challenging "Simon Says" game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to test your memory! In this game, players need to remember and repeat a sequence of colors, with a new color being added at each level. The game continues as long as the player successfully repeats the sequence.

## Features

- **Color Sequence Memory Test**: Players are presented with a sequence of colors that they must repeat.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: Each successful level adds a new color to the sequence, making the game progressively harder.
- **Interactive UI**: Colorful buttons that flash in sequence for players to follow.
- **Game Over Screen**: Displays a message when the player fails to remember the sequence.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the game, including the color buttons and layout.
- **CSS**: For styling the game interface, including the buttons and animations.
- **JavaScript**: For game logic, including random sequence generation, user input validation, and game state management.
